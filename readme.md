## [obligatory warning:]
### this tool will happily run whatever you ask it to so don't be an idiot and scan your 10gb+ map for all of its stone because your drive will fill up pretty quickly. minecraft save files are compressed for a reason and this tool will basically act as a decompression bomb if you use it like a dumbass.

# Usage:
download file from https://github.com/InsideBSITheSecond/minecraft-scanner/releases
```
chmod +x minecraft-scanner
./minecraft-scanner
```
